Portfolio displaying some of the work I have done in Graphics and Video
This is a small growing portfolio of some of the graphics work that I have done since January 2017. I currently intern for a start-up company calle activvely, and I creat graphics for them. I uploaded an example of a graphic I have made for them. 
Secondly, I created a poster for an event I heleped plan for a company Called Colour. The poster and variations of the poster are uploaded to the git. 
The poster is also displayed on their website at http://www.getcolour.io/gsu

I also attatched one poster I made for this event.
